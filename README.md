# OCR

**OCR Digit Recognition** with CNN is a project that builds a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of digits (1 to 70) using TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, and Matplotlib. The project preprocesses grayscale images by resizing and applying thresholding, then trains a CNN model to recognize digits. The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy and loss plots.

**Key Features**
Dataset: The dataset consists of images organized by digit categories (1-70), stored in directories.
Model: A CNN model is used, with two convolutional layers, pooling, dropout, and dense layers, followed by a softmax output layer for classification.
Early Stopping: Prevents overfitting by monitoring validation loss.
Training and Evaluation: Plots for training and validation accuracy/loss over epochs are displayed.

**Requirements**
Python 3.x
TensorFlow, NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn.
